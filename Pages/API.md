These are projects I'm working on to create wrappers to online services and resources.  

## [musixmatch](https://github.com/rweyant/musixmatch)
An **R** wrapper for [musixmatch's](https://www.musixmatch.com/) API. Musixmatch offers a catalog for song lyrics and other information about songs, albums and artists.  You can use their API to gather data about what albums an artist has released, to what songs are on each album, to what an artist's webpage and Twitter handle are.  The API wrapper supports all methods to the API and offers basic simplification to some functions

## [QPX Express](https://github.com/rweyant/googleflights)
An **R** wrapper for QPX Express's API (aka [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/)).  QPX Express was acquired by Google and offers a query service into global airline pricing and shopping. The R wrapper is capable of handling all inputs to the API, and offers some ability to simplify and collapse the results.
